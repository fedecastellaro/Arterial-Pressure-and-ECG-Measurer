## Arterial Pressure and ECG Measurer

Circuit designed to measure the signal corresponding to the arterial pressure of a patient in a non-invasive way. This is done using the device shown below:

This device is especially adapted to measure the difference in pressures that are generated when it is supported on the carotid artery, located in the human neck.

The signal generated by this, is then connected to the following circuit (more info about it in the report called "Informe_ECG_INFO2.pdf"):

The output of the circuit, after the amplification and filtering of the signal is shown as follow:

## Disclaimer:

As shown, a pressure sensor was connected to the final circuit to measure the shape of the blood pressure signal. However, with another suitably chosen sensor, it is possible to measure the ECG signal without modifying the base circuit.

## Disclaimer #2:

This circuit was finally modified in future versions, to which many aspects were improved.
